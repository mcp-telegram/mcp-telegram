# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.37.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added

- `TELEGRAM_USE_WSS` env-var. When set to `true`, gramJS uses port `443` instead of the default `80` for the MTProto TCPFull transport. This unblocks deployments on VPS/hosting IP ranges where outbound port `80` to Telegram DC IP blocks is dropped (anti-abuse policy on some shared-VPS providers), which otherwise hangs the client forever in `Connecting to ...:80/TCPFull...`. Default is `false`, so existing setups are unaffected. Contributed by Ivan Ponomarev (@Baho73).
- When `TELEGRAM_USE_WSS=true` is combined with `TELEGRAM_PROXY_*` (which gramJS cannot do — SSL transport over a proxy is unsupported), the conflict is now detected early: a clear warning is logged and `useWSS` is ignored, letting the proxy take precedence, instead of crashing deep inside `connect()`.

## [1.36.5] — 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Dependency update (devDep only, no behavioral or API changes): `tsx` `^4.22.3` → `^4.22.4`. Used to run the server outside Docker (`dev`/`login` scripts); not part of the published runtime. All three lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lock`) synced.

## [1.36.4] — 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Dependency update (devDep only): `@biomejs/biome` `^2.4.15` → `^2.4.16` (lint/format only).

## [1.36.3] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- CI-only fix. The `publish-binaries` job in `.github/workflows/publish.yml` failed for v1.36.2 because `bun install --frozen-lockfile` rejected the `@biomejs/biome` 2.4.14 → 2.4.15 drift in `package.json` (since the bump went through `npm install` which doesn't touch `bun.lock`). Dropped `--frozen-lockfile` from the compile-only job (npm consumers are unaffected — that job already validated the dependency tree via `npm ci` against `package-lock.json`). Bun runner version bumped 1.3.11 → 1.3.13 to pick up registry resolver fixes.

No code changes since v1.36.2. This release exists only to re-trigger `publish-binaries` against the corrected workflow.

## [1.36.2] — 2026-05-10

### Changed

- Dependency updates (no behavioral changes, no API surface changes):
  - `@biomejs/biome` `^2.4.14` → `^2.4.15` (devDep, lint/format only)
  - `biome.json` schema bumped to 2.4.15 via `biome migrate --write`
- `npm audit fix` resolved 9 transitive advisories pulled in via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`:
  - `hono` 4.12.9 → 4.12.18 (CSS injection in JSX SSR, JWT NumericDate, Cache `Vary`, etc.)
  - `fast-uri` 3.1.0 → 3.1.2 (host confusion + path traversal)
  - `ip-address` 10.1.0 → 10.2.0 (Address6 HTML XSS)
  - `@hono/node-server` 1.19.11 → 1.19.14 (middleware bypass via repeated slashes)
  - `express-rate-limit` 8.3.1 → 8.5.1
- 3 remaining moderate advisories in `vitepress → vite → esbuild` are dev-only (docs site) with no upstream fix available.

## [1.36.1] — 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- Add `big-integer` as a direct dependency. Previously it was imported by `src/telegram-client.ts` and `src/telegram-helpers.ts` but only resolved transitively, which broke `tsc --noEmit` on strict-hoisting installers like pnpm.

### Changed

- Dependency updates (no behavioral changes):
  - `zod` `^4.3.6` → `^4.4.3` (patch bump, runtime backward-compatible)
  - `@biomejs/biome` `^2.4.13` → `^2.4.14` (devDep, lint/format only)

## [1.36.0] — 2026-04-28

### Added

**Tool manifest export — introspect the catalog without standing up an MCP transport.**

A new `@overpod/mcp-telegram/manifest` subpath export and `mcp-telegram-manifest` bin entry let consumers (and downstream cloud distributions) ask the package "what tools do you register, and at what risk tier?" without booting a real Telegram session.

```ts
import { getToolManifest } from "@overpod/mcp-telegram/manifest";

const m = getToolManifest();
// {
//   generatedAt: "2026-04-28T...Z",
//   toolCount: 181,
//   tiers: { "read-only": 74, write: 96, destructive: 11 },
//   tools: [{ name: "telegram-status", tier: "read-only", description: "...", hasInput: false }, ...]
// }
```

CLI variant:

```bash
mcp-telegram-manifest                # writes manifest.json
mcp-telegram-manifest path/out.json  # writes to path/out.json
mcp-telegram-manifest -               # writes JSON to stdout
```

How it works: instantiates an `McpServer`, calls the existing `registerTools()` with a stub service (only types matter — every `telegram.*` call lives inside async tool callbacks, not the registration phase), then introspects the SDK's registered tools and classifies each by `annotations`:

- `destructiveHint: true` → `destructive`
- `readOnlyHint: true` → `read-only`
- otherwise → `write`

Opt-in env flags (`MCP_TELEGRAM_ENABLE_STARS`, `MCP_TELEGRAM_ENABLE_GROUP_CALLS`, `MCP_TELEGRAM_ENABLE_QUICK_REPLIES`) are forced ON during introspection so consumers always see the full catalog, then restored to the caller's prior values. The result is cached for the process lifetime.

This is the foundation for upstream parity gates (e.g. cloud distributions that ship a curated whitelist can detect drift in CI by comparing their whitelist against `getToolManifest().tools`).

### Notes

- New public API surface; no breaking changes to existing exports.
- `src/manifest.ts` and 13 new tests added; total test count: 505.
- Build now sets executable bits on all `dist/*-cli.js` outputs (was npm-install-time only for `bin` entries).

## [1.35.0] — 2026-04-25

### Changed

**Rate limiter — structured stderr events for retries.**

The internal `RateLimiter` previously logged `FLOOD_WAIT` and network retries as
human-readable strings via `console.error`, and the temporary-server-error
branch (5xx, etc.) was silent. All three retry branches now emit a single
structured stderr line per event:

```
[rate-limiter] event {"event":"flood_wait","context":"list-chats","seconds":30,"attempt":1,"maxRetries":3}
```

Event types: `flood_wait`, `network_retry`, `temporary_retry`. Each event
carries:

- `event` — event class (string literal)
- `context` — caller-supplied operation name (never user input / PII)
- `attempt` / `maxRetries` — retry counters
- `seconds` (flood_wait only) or `delayMs` (network/temporary)
- `error` (network/temporary only) — the upstream Telegram error message

This is a logging contract change, not a behaviour change: retry timing,
backoff, and error-throwing semantics are identical to 1.34.0.

### Why this matters

Downstream log collectors can now aggregate retry rates by event class and
caller without parsing free-form English. `mcp-telegram-cloud` v1.12.0+ wires
this into SigNoz directly. Self-hosters can `grep '\[rate-limiter\] event'` or
pipe into any structured log pipeline.

### Compatibility

No breaking changes. No new dependencies. No new environment variables.
Tests: 490/490 pass.

## [1.34.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added

- **telegram-set-business-intro** — Intro card shown to new users: `title` (≤32) + `description` (≤70) + optional sticker (requires `stickerId` + `stickerAccessHash` + `stickerFileReference` all together). `clear=true` removes

### Notes
- All Premium-gated tools (`telegram-set-emoji-status`, `telegram-set-profile-color` with index ≥ 7 or `backgroundEmojiId`) throw `PREMIUM_ACCOUNT_REQUIRED` from Telegram on non-Premium accounts — the error is propagated as-is
- All Business-gated tools throw `BUSINESS_PEER_INVALID` or similar when the account lacks Telegram Business subscription
- `telegram-get-business-chat-links` moved to `src/tools/business.ts` — tool name and behavior unchanged
- `telegram-set-profile-photo`: uploads via GramJS `uploadFile` (4 workers). Video must be square MP4, ≤10s; server enforces its own size limits
- `telegram-delete-profile-photo`: calls `photos.GetUserPhotos` first (up to 100) to resolve `accessHash` + `fileReference` from the photo ID; IDs not in your history are returned in `missing` array

### Added
- **telegram-send-story** — Publish a photo or video story to your profile or a channel with privacy controls (everyone/contacts/close_friends/selected), period (6-48h), pinning, and no-forward flag. Accepts absolute file path, auto-detects photo/video from extension (jpg/jpeg/png/webp/heic/heif → photo; everything else → video). Caption supports md/html parse mode.
- **telegram-edit-story** — Edit an existing story: replace media, update caption (empty string clears it), or change privacy rules. At least one field (filePath, caption, or privacy) must be provided.
- **telegram-delete-stories** — Delete one or more stories (irreversible; requires `confirm: true`; up to 100 IDs per call). Returns the actually-deleted IDs from Telegram (partial success possible).

- **telegram-get-stories-archive** — Fetch auto-archived (expired) stories from a peer's archive, paginated via `offsetId` + `limit` (1–100, default 50).
- **telegram-report-story** — Report a story via Telegram's multi-step option flow. First call with `option: ""` starts the flow; subsequent calls pass the base64 option bytes from the previous response's `options[n].option` field.
- **telegram-get-discussion-message** — For a channel post with comments enabled, returns the linked discussion-group info: `discussionGroupId`, `discussionMsgId`, `unreadCount`, `readInboxMaxId`, `readOutboxMaxId`, `topMessage`. Use `discussionGroupId` + `discussionMsgId` with `telegram-send-message` (replyTo=discussionMsgId) to post a comment.
- **telegram-get-groups-for-discussion** — List groups eligible to link as discussion group to a channel you admin (channels.GetGroupsForDiscussion). No parameters required.
- **telegram-get-message-read-participants** — List who has read a message in a small group (≤100 members, ≤7 days old). Returns `readers` array with `userId` and `readAt` (ISO timestamp). Returns CHAT_TOO_BIG error for large groups or channels.
- **telegram-get-outbox-read-date** — Get when your recipient read your outgoing private message. Returns `"Read at <ISO date>"` or `"Not read yet"` (maps NOT_READ_YET error to null). Propagates YOUR_PRIVACY_RESTRICTED / USER_PRIVACY_RESTRICTED as errors.

### New helpers in `telegram-helpers.ts`
- `StoryPrivacy` type and `buildStoryPrivacyRules()` — builds GramJS `TypeInputPrivacyRule[]` from privacy enum + allow/disallow user ID lists

- `telegram-activate-stealth-mode` requires Telegram Premium — non-Premium accounts receive PREMIUM_ACCOUNT_REQUIRED
- `telegram-get-message-read-participants` only works for groups ≤100 members and messages ≤7 days old
- `telegram-delete-stories` requires `confirm: true` (irreversible)
- `telegram-send-story`: MediaAreas (venue/reaction/URL tags on the story frame) are not supported in this version
- `telegram-report-story`: Multi-step flow — first call with `option: ""` starts the flow; subsequent calls pass the base64 option bytes from the previous response

### Testing
- 45 new mock-only tests in `src/__tests__/stories-v2.test.ts` (cumulative: 418 total)

## [1.29.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Phase 5 Block A — Rich media sending (7 new tools)** — functional parity with Telegram UI for content types that could not be sent before.
  - `telegram-send-voice` — send a voice note (OGG/Opus preferred) with optional caption, parseMode, reply/topic. Shows as a waveform UI in the chat.
  - `telegram-send-video-note` — send a round-shaped video message (MP4, square recommended; duration ≤60s enforced client-side, length ≤640px).
  - `telegram-send-location` — send a geographic location; single tool handles both static pins and live-updating locations (`livePeriod` 60–86400 seconds; optional `heading` 1–360°, `proximityRadius` meters).
  - `telegram-send-venue` — send a venue card (title, address, lat/long + optional provider-specific metadata).
  - `telegram-send-contact` — send a contact card (phone number in E.164-like format `^\+?\d{6,15}$`, first name, optional last name and vCard).
  - `telegram-send-dice` — send an animated dice/game emoji (🎲 🎯 🎰 🏀 ⚽ 🎳) and receive the server-rolled value in the response.
  - `telegram-send-album` — send 2–10 grouped photos/videos as a single album message with per-item or album-level caption.
- **Block B — enhancements to existing `telegram-send-message`:**
  - `quoteText` — attach a verbatim quote from the replied-to message (requires `replyTo`). Uses raw `messages.SendMessage` + `InputReplyToMessage.quoteText` under the hood.
  - `effect` — Premium message effect ID (numeric string) attached to the outgoing message.
- **Defence-in-depth for file-path inputs (`isSafeAbsolutePath`)** — all new `filePath` parameters reject:
  - URL schemes (`http:`, `https:`, `file:`, `ftp:`, `data:`, `javascript:`, `ws:`, `wss:`) — no SSRF via GramJS URL-fetching.
  - UNC / SMB shares (`\\server\share`, `//server/share`) — no NTLM-relay from Windows hosts.
  - Path traversal (`..` segments inside an absolute path) — no escape out of the intended directory.
  - POSIX pseudo-filesystems (`/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/run`) — prevents AI prompt-injection from reading `/proc/self/environ` and leaking env vars / session paths to Telegram.
  - Embedded NUL byte and bare `/` — rejected explicitly.
- **UTF-16 surrogate sanitation on input** — all free-text parameters (message `text`, captions, venue title/address/provider/venueId/venueType, contact name/vCard, quoteText) now strip unpaired surrogates before reaching GramJS's TL encoder. Complements the existing v1.11.1 output-side fix.
- **Shared helpers in `telegram-helpers.ts`:**
  - `buildReplyTo(replyTo?, topicId?)` — construct `InputReplyToMessage` (supports topic root where `replyToMsgId === topicId`).
  - `generateRandomBigInt()` — cryptographically-random 64-bit `long` for TL `randomId`.
  - `extractMessageId(result)` — unified parser across `Api.Updates`, `UpdatesCombined`, `Api.Message`, `UpdateShortSentMessage`, `UpdateNewMessage`, `UpdateNewChannelMessage`.
  - `extractDiceResult(result)` — dice-specific extractor returning `{id, value?}` from `MessageMediaDice`.

### Changed
- `telegram-send-contact`: `phone` field now validated against `^\+?\d{6,15}$` (E.164-like) to reject malformed/hallucinated numbers.
- `telegram-send-venue`: `provider` relaxed from a 2-value enum to a free string (≤32 chars) to match TL `venueProvider: string`.
- `TelegramService.sendMessage()`: gained an optional 6th `extra: { quoteText?, effect? }` parameter. When set, falls back to raw `messages.SendMessage` (high-level `client.sendMessage` does not support these fields). Backward-compatible — existing callers see no change.

### Security
- `quoteText` without `replyTo` now raises a clear error instead of silently dropping the quote.
- GramJS private `_parseMessageText` usage in the quoteText/effect raw path is feature-detected; future GramJS bumps surface a clear "version incompatible" error instead of crashing.
- `effect` ID regex tightened to `^\d{1,19}$` (Int64-safe range).

### Testing
- 371 unit tests (was 322 in v1.28.1, +49). All tests mock-only (no live Telegram connection).
- New coverage: all 8 new/changed service methods, helper edge cases (channel path, combined updates, direct Api.Message, UpdateShortSentMessage), SSRF guard (POSIX/Windows accept + URL/UNC/traversal/pseudo-fs reject), raw-path `sendMessage` with `quoteText` / `effect`.

### Notes & known limitations
- **`telegram-send-video-note` caption omitted** — Telegram UI does not render captions under round video notes; including it here would silently drop.
- **`telegram-send-contact.userId` field dropped** — GramJS 2.26.22 `InputMediaContact` TL schema (Layer 198) has no `userId` slot. The card is standalone; recipients see the number and name, not a link to a Telegram user. Will return once GramJS advances.
- **TTL / self-destruct media** — deferred. Requires raw `InputMediaUploadedPhoto({ttlSeconds})` path which bypasses the high-level `sendFile`; will ship in a follow-up.
- **`telegram-send-voice.duration` removed vs. initial design** — GramJS auto-detects duration from the audio file; letting the AI override it caused the Telegram UI to display wrong playback times.
- **Album mixed photo+video** — GramJS accepts mixed arrays via extension-based detection, but this is not covered by tests; recommend uniform media type per album until a live-test checkpoint confirms.
- **Album flood control** — a 10-item album fans out 10 `messages.UploadMedia` calls inside one rate-limit slot; under heavy contention the later items may still hit `FLOOD_WAIT`. Rate limiter retries apply.

  - `telegram-get-state` — initialize a polling cursor (`pts`, `qts`, `date`, `seq`)
  - `telegram-get-updates` — fetch global updates since a known cursor via `updates.GetDifference`; returns `{newMessages, deletedMessageIds, otherUpdates, state, isFinal}` and surfaces `DifferenceTooLong` as a history-fallback hint
  - `telegram-get-channel-updates` — per-channel polling via `updates.GetChannelDifference`
  - Cursors are client-owned (stateless server) — the agent stores `{pts, qts, date}` between calls
- **Phase 4 ship — Stories, Boosts, Business (8 tools)**
  - `telegram-get-all-stories` — list stories across peers with pagination state
  - `telegram-get-peer-stories` — list stories posted by one peer (compact, media refs only)
  - `telegram-get-stories-by-id` — fetch specific story items by id
  - `telegram-get-story-views` — list views on your own stories (Premium for full stats)
  - `telegram-get-my-boosts` — list boost slots assigned by your account
  - `telegram-get-boosts-status` — boost status for a channel/supergroup
  - `telegram-get-boosts-list` — list boosters for a channel (admin)
  - `telegram-get-business-chat-links` — list your Telegram Business chat links
- **Phase 4 opt-in (env-gated, 6 tools)** — registered only when the corresponding flag is set:
  - `MCP_TELEGRAM_ENABLE_GROUP_CALLS=1` → `telegram-get-group-call`, `telegram-get-group-call-participants`
  - `MCP_TELEGRAM_ENABLE_STARS=1` → `telegram-get-stars-status`, `telegram-get-stars-transactions`
  - `MCP_TELEGRAM_ENABLE_QUICK_REPLIES=1` → `telegram-get-quick-replies`, `telegram-get-quick-reply-messages`

## [1.25.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Scheduled messages** — `telegram-get-scheduled`, `telegram-delete-scheduled`
- **Threads & replies** — `telegram-get-replies` for channel post comments
- **Message links** — `telegram-get-message-link` returns public t.me URL for a message
- **Mentions & unread reactions** — `telegram-get-unread-mentions`, `telegram-get-unread-reactions`
- **Translate** — `telegram-translate-message` (requires Telegram Premium)
- **Typing indicator** — `telegram-send-typing` with configurable action
- **Dialog management** — `telegram-archive-chat`, `telegram-pin-chat`, `telegram-mark-dialog-unread`
- **Drafts** — `telegram-save-draft`, `telegram-get-drafts`, `telegram-clear-drafts`
- **Saved Messages dialogs** — `telegram-get-saved-dialogs` for the new per-peer Saved Messages folders
- **Admin log** — `telegram-get-admin-log` for channel/supergroup moderation history
- **Reactions catalog** — `telegram-set-default-reaction`, `telegram-get-top-reactions`, `telegram-get-recent-reactions`
- **Chat permissions** — `telegram-set-chat-permissions` for default banned rights
- **Slow mode** — `telegram-set-slow-mode` for supergroups
- **Forum topics CRUD** — `telegram-create-topic`, `telegram-edit-topic`, `telegram-delete-topic`
- **Web page preview** — `telegram-get-web-preview` to inspect link previews before sending

### Fixed
- `telegram-set-chat-permissions` now merges with the chat's current `defaultBannedRights` — omitted flags keep their current state instead of being silently cleared
- `telegram-clear-drafts` requires `chatId` (single-chat) or `confirmAllChats: true` to wipe drafts account-wide, preventing accidental loss of all drafts in one call
- `telegram-get-unread-mentions` and `telegram-get-unread-reactions` are now annotated as `WRITE` — they mark the listed items as read on the server
- `telegram-translate-message` is now annotated as `WRITE` (consumes Premium translate quota); `toLang` is validated against an ISO-639 / locale pattern and `messageIds` is capped at 1–100 positive integers
- `telegram-delete-scheduled` caps `messageIds` at 1–100 positive integers
- `telegram-set-default-reaction` validates `emoji` length (1–8 characters)
- `telegram-get-web-preview` rejects non-`http(s)` URLs, preventing use as an SSRF proxy
- `telegram-send-typing` throttles non-`cancel` actions to once per 10 seconds per chat
- `telegram-get-saved-dialogs` no longer returns a hard-coded `unreadCount: 0`
- `telegram-create-topic` now reads the new topic ID from `UpdateNewChannelMessage` (authoritative) and fails loudly if neither source is available
- `telegram-save-draft` drops `replyTo` when the draft text is empty, avoiding `MESSAGE_EMPTY` errors when clearing drafts
- Removed unused `chatMap` build in `getAdminLog`
